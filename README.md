Call Center Solution Dashboard

Project Overview

This project was developed during my Power BI Developer Internship at PwC. It focuses on creating a comprehensive Call Center Solution Dashboard to provide actionable insights into call center performance, enabling better decision-making and operational efficiency.

Key Features Interactive Visualizations: The dashboard includes dynamic and interactive charts, graphs, and KPIs to monitor performance. Comprehensive Metrics: Covers key metrics such as call volume trends, agent performance, customer satisfaction rates, and resolution times. Data Modeling: Designed efficient data models with relationships and calculated measures using DAX functions. Data Cleaning and Transformation: Utilized Power Query for data preparation and ensured clean and accurate datasets. Actionable Insights: Identified bottlenecks and patterns to optimize call center operations and improve customer experience.

Insights from the Dashboard Peak Call Volume Periods: Identified the busiest times of the day and week, enabling better scheduling and resource allocation. Agent Performance: Highlighted top-performing agents based on resolution times and customer feedback. Customer Satisfaction Trends: Analyzed patterns in customer satisfaction scores to identify areas needing improvement. Resolution Time Analysis: Pinpointed calls with extended resolution times to address inefficiencies. Call Types Breakdown: Categorized and visualized different call types to better understand customer needs.

Technologies Used Power BI: For dashboard development and visualization. DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): For custom calculations and measures. Power Query: For data cleaning and transformation.

Key Learnings Developed expertise in advanced Power BI functionalities, including data modeling and complex DAX formulas. Gained insights into optimizing visual storytelling for business intelligence. Learned to transform raw data into meaningful insights to support decision-making.
